		<h2>Algorithm Overview and Execution</h2>
		<h3>Reconstruction via Structure from Motion (SfM)</h3>
		<p>
			Below is the simplified algorithm used for SfM, with detailed explanations available in the code comments:
			<ol>
				<li>Initiate the process by selecting the first two images to estimate the initial pose and perform triangulation.</li>
				<li>Carry out initial triangulation using the selected image pair.</li>
				<li>Create an initial 3D point cloud and assess the reprojection error for these images.</li>
				<li>Sequentially integrate each subsequent image by:
					<ol>
						<li>Calculating its camera pose.</li>
						<li>Triangulating new points considering the current viewpoint.</li>
						<li>Expanding the 3D point cloud with the newly triangulated points and recalculating reprojection errors for the updated camera perspective.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Reprojection Error Calculation</h3>
		<p>
			The reprojection error is determined through the steps below:
			<ol>
				<li>Collect image data and features, discarding references to non-valid 3D points.</li>
				<li>Derive 3D points from the valid references and project them back onto the image plane.</li>
				<li>Measure the discrepancy between the original and projected 2D points, omitting significant outliers.</li>
				<li>Compute the mean reprojection error.</li>
				<li>Visualize the final analysis.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Point Triangulation for New Views</h3>
		<p>
			To effectively filter outliers, a mix of reprojection error assessment and depth analysis was employed, yielding optimal results. The procedure for incorporating new viewpoints involves:
			<ol>
				<li>Scanning through existing views to identify matching features with the new image.</li>
				<li>Refining matches to only include those not yet associated with any point in the cloud.</li>
				<li>For each relevant pair of matched views:
					<ol>
						<li>Match alignment and extraction of corresponding 2D points from each image.</li>
						<li>Execution of triangulation to generate 3D points across the views.</li>
						<li>Application of filters to the triangulated points based on reprojection errors and spatial positioning, adhering to dynamically set thresholds.</li>
						<li>Incorporation of the validated points into the overarching point cloud and updating reference indices for the new image.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
